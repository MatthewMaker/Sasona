<h1>Frequently asked questions about Sasona Cooperative</h1> 

<!--
    <h2>What is Sasona?</h2>

<p>Sasona (pronounced Suh-Soh-Nuh) is a group-equity community housing cooperative. <rel href="about.html" target="_blank" title="Sasona about page"> Abot Sasona</rel>
</p>
-->
    <h2>What is a co-op?</h2>

    <p>According to the NASCO website:</p> 

<p>“A cooperative is a business controlled by the people who use it. It is a democratic organization whose earnings and assets belong to its members. By patronizing and becoming an active member of a co-op, you invest yourself with the power to shape that business. You control the politics and economics of what is truly your organization. </p>
 

<p>“This localized member control allows co-ops to be as varied as the people they serve. Thus, there are different types of co-ops including: food co-ops, housing co-ops, arts and crafts co-ops, book co-ops, bakery co-ops, bike co-ops, farm co-ops, rural electric co-ops, financial co-ops (credit unions), and insurance co-ops. And each of these has a flavor of its own, reflective of the desires of its individual memberships. Despite the diversity in type and tradition of co-ops, most have several things in common, particularly the ideals and principles from which they emerge.”</p> 

    <p>For more info about why coops are such a good idea, check out:</p>

<h2>What principles does Sasona follow? </h2>

    <p>Sasona, like many coops, follows the Rochdale Principles of cooperation: </p>
<ol>
<li> Voluntary and open membership</li>

<li> Democratic member control</li>

<li> Member economic participation</li>
<li> Autonomy and independence</li>

<li> Education, training, and information</li>

<li> Cooperation among cooperatives</li>
<li> Concern for community</li>

<h2>How much is the deposit?</h2> 

<p>Before you move in, you must pay a refundable $500 deposit. The first month’s rent is also due when you move in.</p> 

 <!---- make scroll over page to show rent for each room ---->

<h2>How much is rent?</h2> 

<p> Rent varies from $559 to $874, depending on the size of the room. Visit our house layout page for an idea of room costs: <a href="tour.html"title="Virtual tour" target="_blank">House Plan</a></p>
<p>An associate membership, which inlcudes meals and use of all utilities,is $80 per month </p>
 
<h2>What does rent pay for?</h2> 

<p>Rent covers all utilities and bills, internet connection in every room, wireless connection throughout most of the house, a printer with scanner and copier functions, TV/DVD/VCR, three living rooms, a big backyard, vegetarian dinner seven nights a week (although meat eaters are welcome and in fact the majority of the house eats meat), a stocked kitchen, and free laundry.</p> 

<h2>How do I become a member?</h2> 

<p>Sasona follows the cooperative principle of Open Membership. We strive to create an open and diverse community in which all people and lifestyles are accepted and valued.</p>

<p>In order to be accepted as a potential member, prospective members must attend two meetings. (Former members must also attend two meetings and go through the acceptance process again.) Per this requirement, you gain the opportunity to ask questions, meet the members, and make an informed decision about whether you will be happy living here or being an associate. If you are living out of state or if there is some reason that you cannot attend the meetings in person, you can attend via crackly speakerphone or Skype/Face Time. If you work every Sunday night, you can make arrangements with the Membership Coordinator to attend meetings on different nights – we just request that you give us 3 days’ advance notice.</p> 

<p>At the first meeting, the meeting chair will ask if you have any pets, if you understand the labor requirements, and why you want to live here.</p> 

<p>At the second meeting, all non-members will be asked to leave the room, and the Meeting Chair will ask, “Does anyone have any firsthand knowledge of why this prospective member could be evicted from the house (including for non-payment of rent, abusive behavior, disrupting the right of quiet enjoyment, instilling fear in others, and any other evictable behavior)?” If no one does, then you will be accepted as a potential member.</p> 

<p>If someone does have firsthand knowledge of why a prospective member could be evicted, then the meeting will discuss it and vote on whether the prospective should be accepted as a member. According to the House Rules, prospective members “must receive a 90% majority vote at a house meeting to be accepted.” So, if someone states that they have firsthand knowledge of why a prospective would be evicted, 90% of the people voting would have to accept the prospective in order for them to be accepted as a potential member. If they are not accepted, they cannot sign a contract, and they cannot become a member. [Note: The House Rules were written at a time when all votes, in order to pass, had to be approved by 90% of the votes. The voting majority has since changed, but the House Rules have not.]</p>
 

<p>People who are accepted as members will be put on the Prospective Members Waiting List. When a room is available, all of the members of the house (who can switch rooms if they want) and all people on the waiting list will be alerted. If several people are interested in a room, and they are able to move in when the room is available and pay the deposit right away, then who gets the room will be determined based on several factors, such as who attended their second meeting first.</p>
 

<p>Who is higher on the waiting list is important, but the <em>most</em> important factors determining whether you get a room are the flexibility of your living situation (whether you can move in as soon as a room is open), whether you can pay the deposit right away, and whether you check your email regularly to receive the updates about room openings.</p>
 

<p>Meetings are generally held on Sunday nights around 7:30-8pm. Please show up at 7pm and have dinner with us. That will give you a chance to meet some people, take a tour of the house, and ask some questions about the house before the meeting starts. Dinner will be your chance to ask questions, then during the meeting you’ll have a chance to watch house governance in action. You’re welcome to stay for the whole meeting, but it’s not required.</p> 

<p>It’s best to contact the Membership Coordinator beforehand to let them know you are planning on attending the meeting. But if you show up out of the blue, that’s fine too. Just let yourself in the front door and let people know you’re here to check out the house—we’ll be expecting visitors. You can ask if the membership coordinator is around to give you a tour, or whoever you meet can give you a tour (unless they’re busy cooking dinner).</p> 
    
<h2>What is the length of the lease I have to sign?</h2>

<p>Contracts must be for at least 6 months.</p> 

<h2>How long is the waiting list?</h2> 

<p>We have a list of people who have been accepted as potential members. When a room opens up, we contact everyone who has been accepted, in order of acceptance. If several people are interested in a room, and they are able to move in when the room is available and pay the deposit right away, then who gets the room will be determined based on several factors, such as who attended their second meeting first (i.e. who is higher on the “waiting list”). So we can’t really say for sure how many people want the room until we offer it to everyone and get responses.</p> 

<p>Who is higher on the waiting list is important, but the *most* important factors determining whether you get a room are the flexibility of your living situation (whether you can move in as soon as a room is open), whether you can pay the deposit right away, and whether you check your email regularly to receive the updates about room openings. </p>

 <h2>What’s the chance that I’ll get a room?</h2> 

<p>It’s hard to say. The only thing we can tell you for sure is that you have no chance of getting a room if you don’t attend two meetings and become accepted as a potential member. We can also tell you that attending two meetings as soon as possible will improve your chances, because you’ll be higher on the waiting list. Typically there are only a few people interested in an opening at a certain time, so if you are interested, and you are available to move in when the room opens, you have a good shot of getting the room. </p> 

<h2>How does house governance work?</h2>

<p>We have house meetings every Sunday night. Every member is welcome to write items on the agenda for discussion or voting. More than a 75% majority is required to pass a motion. It’s exciting to take part in a truly member-owned, member-run organization!</p> 

<h2>Who cooks and cleans and pays the bills?</h2>

<p>We do!  This means that all 17 members of the household have vital roles to play in the daily functioning of the house.  We divide all necessary tasks up into an organized labor system to ensure that the house runs as smoothly as possible.</p>
 
<h2>How does the Labor System work?</h2> 

<p>As a member of our cooperative, you will perform 5 “lumps” of labor a week. (A “lump” is a unit of labor that is roughly equivalent to one hour of work.) When you move in, the Labor Czar will assign you labor based on what you would like to do. The Labor Czar will work with your schedule and try their best to give you labor that you’ll enjoy.</p> 

<p>Labor positions include: washing dishes, cleaning the kitchen, cooking dinner, cleaning living rooms and bathrooms, performing house maintenance, cleaning the yard, etc. There are also elected positions, which include: Board Members, Membership Coordinator, Treasurer, Bookkeeper, Labor Coordinator, Kitchen Manager, Menu Planner, Food Shopper, Grounds Coordinator, Maintenance Coordinator, Meeting Chair, Minutes Taker, and House ‘Zine Editor. Everyone is welcome to run for these positions, and they are a great opportunity to learn various skill sets. All labor roles are vital and we encourage everyone to participate by proposing and managing improvement projects for our organization.</p> 

<h2>How do we ensure that all the labor gets done?</h2> 

<p>When someone doesn’t show up for their labor, that’s known as a “no-show.” There is a public sheet posted in the house for people to write no-shows on. If I notice that Fred didn’t do the dishes last night, I can no-show him by writing it on the sheet. If he doesn’t have a good excuse for missing his labor, then he will be given a make-up labor. He has to communicate with the Labor Coordinator, Kitchen Manager, Grounds Coordinator, or Maintenance Coordinator to find a project that needs doing so he can work off the labor he owes. If he does not finish all of his make-up labor by a certain cut-off date, he will be fined $10 per lump of unfinished labor. If Fred continues to neglect his labor, he might eventually be evicted from the house. No-shows provide an incentive to everyone to get their labor done on time, which ensures that the house runs smoothly.</p>  

<h2>Can I share a room with a roommate?</h2> 

<p>Yes. However, you wouldn’t just split the cost of the room. $150 of rent goes toward non-rent-related items: utilities, internet, food, etc. So your roommate would also have to pay $150, on top of the price of the room. For example, if the room is $600/month, you would add $150 to that price, then divide it by two—each of you would pay $400/month.</p> 

<p>The charge for each extra person in a room per month is as follows: for ages 0-6: $100; for ages 7-12: $150; for ages 13+: $200. </p>
<h2>Can dogs live here?</h2> 
<p>No. Unfortunately, due to numerous unavoidable problems, dogs are no longer allowed to live at Sasona (with the exception of service dogs).</p>

<h2>Can cats live here?</h2> 

<p>Yes, cats are allowed. However, in order to limit the flea problem and the effect on those with allergies, no more than five cats are allowed to live at Sasona at one time, and each member is not allowed to own more than 2 cats. Please inquire about whether we have reached our five-cat limit.</p> 

<p>There is one side of the house, consisting of the kitchen, dining room, TV room, and the 8 adjacent rooms to the right of the front entrance door, where cats are not allowed.</p> 

<p>All pets must be approved by the house. If you have a pet, you need to tell us at both of your meetings. It is not just you that will need to be accepted at the meeting—your pet will also need to be accepted, so you need to tell us about your pet so that it can be approved by the house. If your pet has any issues that might affect other people or pets in the house, or if you think your pet might have some difficulty in a house with 17 people, please let us know.</p> 

<p>You must pay a $100 deposit for each pet you are bringing into the house. $50 is non-refundable. The pet owner is also responsible for any damage done to carpet, rugs, walls, furniture, smell, etc., above and beyond what is normally expected to put the room back into its pre-pet condition. This means a pet owner can be charged additional costs if needed.</p> 

<b>No tigers allowed.</b>

<h2>I’m allergic to cats, can I still live here?</h2> 

<p>There is one side of the house, consisting of the kitchen, dining room, TV room, and the 8 adjacent rooms to the right of the front entrance door, where cats are not allowed.</p> 

<p>If you have allergies, please ask the membership coordinator if there are any rooms available in the pet-free side of the house.
</p>
 
<h2>Are guns allowed?</h2>

<p>No. No guns are allowed on the property.</p>
 
    <h2>Is smoking allowed?</h2>

<p> No smoking is allowed in the house, not even in your room. There is a smoking area on the front porch with an ash tray for your butts</p> 
<h2>Can I eat meat in the house?</h2>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>Sasona only buys and serves vegetarian food. However, in the spirit of inclusion, the members are welcome to use the kitchen for their own personal food, including meat. The reason that the house is vegetarian is largely due to the economics of eating cheaper better foods, and the ease of keeping a vegetarian kitchen sanitary. Traditionally, the majority of the house has been omnivores, with vegetarians being in the minority.</p>

<p>When members cook meat in the kitchen, they should respect the vegetarian nature of the house. This should be done by completely sanitizing all used cooking and preparation surfaces, by not cooking meat at times that the house's vegetarian meals are being prepared, and by running the ventilation system in the kitchen at all times that meat is being privately prepared.</p>

    <h2>Are the rooms furnished?</h2> 

<p>No. We do not supply anything. But we might have some various mattresses and pieces of furniture floating around that you might be able to help yourself to. The living rooms are furnished with couches etc.</p>

Sasona Co-op Meeting Info

 

The meeting will be your opportunity to learn more about the house in order to determine whether you will be happy here. We have an open membership policy; everyone is welcome to live here. So we’re not going to interview you—you’re going to interview us. As long as you think you’ll be happy living here and you can follow our house policies regarding rent payment, performance of labor, and civil behavior, then we want you to be our roommate. Attending meetings is your opportunity to find out if you want to live here, so make the most of it!

 

Some meeting tips:

 

1. Read all available information about the house before your meeting… Look at our website www.sasona.org, read our FAQ, and check out some info about coops in general atwww.nasco.coop.

 

2. Ask the members general questions about the house… Please show up at 7pm on Sunday so you can take a tour of the house and eat dinner with us. (Contact the membership coordinator first to make sure there will be a meeting that week.) Dinnertime will be your opportunity to meet some members and ask us questions about what it’s like living here. When the meeting starts, you’ll be given another chance to ask us any questions, and then we will start discussing the regular agenda items.

 

3. Suggested questions… Here’s a list of questions that some people have asked us…

 

How loud is the house?

Do people hang out a lot together?

What do you do for fun?

Does everyone get along with each other?

What’s the best labor?

What’s the worst labor?

What do you like about the coop?

What do you dislike about the coop?

What’s your favorite zombie movie?

<p> meeting
    . You can stick around for the whole meeting, but you’re welcome to leave at any time… If you have time, you’re welcome to stay for some or all of the meeting. This may give you a better idea of how house governance works and how meetings are conducted, what kind of topics we discuss, etc. You’re welcome to say bye at any time—you’re not required to stay for the whole meeting. As long as you’re here during the first few minutes of the meeting, you will be counted as attending one meeting.

 

5. Talk to the Membership Coordinator one on one… If you would like to chat with the Membership Coordinator alone for a little while so you can have some things explained to you in more detail, don’t be afraid to ask.  Before or after the meeting would be a good time to have a more in-depth discussion.

 

6. The second meeting… At your second meeting, we’re going to ask you a couple of questions, and then we’re going to ask you to leave the room. While you are in the other room, we are going to ask “Does anyone have any firsthand knowledge of why this person could be evicted from the house (including for non-payment of rent, abusive behavior, disrupting the right of quiet enjoyment, instilling fear in others, and any other evictable behavior)?” If so, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t live here, but in that case we will have a vote to see if you’re accepted. If no one knows of any reason you likely could be evicted, you are accepted to the house as a potential member and you will be put on the waiting list. The membership coordinator will contact you if a room opens up, and you’ll have an opportunity to sign a contract.
