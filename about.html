		<!--p>Sasona cooperative was founded in June of 2002 by a group
		of alumni from the student cooperatives in Austin. While the student
		cooperatives remain wonderful places to live, there are things that they
		cannot do, such as house non-students in a family friendly residential
		neighborhood, and provide a more adult oriented living experience in a
		smaller group size than is offered by many student cooperatives.</p>

		<p>With the support and assistance of the campus cooperatives and the North
		American Students of Cooperation development consultants, and the Austin
		Non-profit management assistance center, the founding group was able to
		find a spacious 17 bedroom house in the Zilker Park area of South Austin
		and secure a loan to make a down payment on the property. After two
		years of operation, Sasona coop joined NASCO Properties, a confederation
		of cooperatives across North America. Joining NP allows Sasona to be
		more financially secure, and to pool knowledge and resources with other
		cooperatives. For more information on NASCO and NASCO Properties check
		out www.nasco.coop.</p-->

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sasona Cooperative was founded in June of 2002 by a group of alumni from the College Houses and Inter-Cooperative Council student cooperatives in Austin.</p>

<p>With the support and assistance of the campus cooperatives and the North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) development consultants, they found a spacious house in the Zilker Park area of South Austin and secured a loan to make a down payment on the property.</p>

<p>After two years of operation, Sasona Co-op joined NASCO Properties, a confederation of cooperatives across the United States. Joining NASCO Properties provided Sasona with increased financial security and stability. (For more information on the great work done by NASCO and NASCO Properties, check out <a href="http://www.nasco.coop" target="_blank" title="NASCO">www.nasco.coop)</a>.


<h2>Membership Perks</h2>

<!--p>Membership in Sasona coop carries lots of advantages! Members of the
		house enjoy great conveniences such as a stocked kitchen, cooked
		meals, paid utilities and internet access. Sasona is based on the
		principle that your living space support and complement your life, so
		that you can spend your efforts on what matters more to you. There are
		public internet terminals, household tools, kitchen tools, and public
		furniture, along with a TV room, free laundry facilities, public paid
		phones, and on site storage. The goal of the services at Sasona are that
		members have only one bill they have to pay each month, and that all of
		the various living expenses will be taken care of!</p>

		<p>Membership at Sasona also has the advantage of being in control of
		your living environment. As a member you are given the right to help
		decide current and future house policy, review rent rates, or any
		other decisions that need to be brought up. House meetings are held
		each Sunday after dinner, where the agenda consists of anything that
		has been posted by a member, so anyone can bring up anything about
		the house they like for discussion, so long as they are respectful of
		their fellow members. The issues that members post to the house agenda
		will be discussed according to the Robert's Rules of Order (as in ?I
		motion that....? ?I second that....?) as adapted for the more laid back
		environment of the house, and can be voted on if the members wish.</p-->

<p>We believe that that your living space should support and complement your life, so that you can spend your efforts on what matters most to you.</p>

<p>Members of the Sasona enjoy conveniences such as a home-cooked meal every day, a stocked kitchen, paid utilities, free laundry, internet access, and a TV room. And you can't beat our location Sasona is walking distance from several major bus routes, numerous tasty restaurants, a movie theater, a used book store, a grocery store, several consignment shops, and some of the best nature spots in town.</p>

<p>Sasona is a friendly, fun-loving community, where members enjoy family-style shared dinners, movie nights, hiking on the Green Belt, cooling off at Barton Springs, and various other house activities.</p>


<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<!--p>Membership at Sasona is completely open, and our main requirement is
		that prospective members attend two of the house meetings before signing
		a contract. This is set up so that a member can see the house and the
		way that the system works before deciding that they want membership in
		the coop. The first meeting they can ask the members of the house any
		questions they like, as well as answer any questions that they feel like
		answering about themselves, and at the second meeting they need only
		attend and state that they are still interested in the coop. Members are
		given a chance to raise concerns over prospective members if they are
		worried, but the only allowed reason to bring a member's admission up for
		a vote, much less deny them membership, is firsthand knowledge that the
		applicant will be evicted from the house. At Sasona, we believe strongly
		that each person knows what is the best environment for them, and that
		all interested people in the community should be given a chance to try a
		cooperative environment.</p>

		<p>Members get to participate directly in the running of the house by
		taking part in the house labor system, which provides the work that gets
		the dinner cooked each night, keeps the house clean, and makes sure that
		all of the bills are collected and paid. After accepting membership in
		the house, members will be asked to fill out a preference sheet for the
		times and types of labor that fit their needs, and will begin shortly to
		help all of us keep our costs of living as low as possible.</p-->


<p>Sasona follows the Rochdale Principles of cooperation:</p>

<p>We strive to create an open and diverse community in which all people and lifestyles are accepted and valued. Our Open Membership policy ensures that anyone interested in the benefits of cooperative living has the opportunity to live at Sasona. Prospective members must attend two house meetings before being accepted. This allows people to see the house and learn about how the system works before deciding if Sasona is right for them. We believe that each person knows what is the best environment for them, and that all interested people in the community should be given a chance to try a cooperative environment.</p>

<p>Members democratically decide current and future house policy, review rent rates, and make any other decisions about the running of the house. House meetings are held each Sunday after dinner, where the agenda consists of anything that has been posted by members.</p>

<p>Members do 5 hours of labor a week we cook dinner every night, clean the house, work on maintenance projects, maintain the grounds, recruit new members, pay the bills, and perform all other aspects of house governance. After accepting membership in the house, members will be asked to fill out a preference sheet for the times and types of labor that fit their needs, and will begin contributing their hard work to help all of us keep our cost of living as low as possible.</p>
