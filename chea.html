    <h1>Community Housing Expansion of Austin</h1>
    
    <p>Community Housing Expansion of Austin is the 501(C)3 nonprofit
corporation which runs Sasona Coop and its' sibling coops. The Board of
Directors is composed of 2 interested volunteers from each house as
elected by their respective houses, and 1 non-member volunteer as
elected by the CHEA membership. The board's responsibilities includes things such as
the long term financial planning for CHEA, discussing long term
maintenance plans, and keeping the houses legally compliant. The board
is composed of various roles including a Chair, a Secretary, a
Treasurer, community Rep, and Member at Large. Board role assignment is
determined as needed by the Board. Board representative terms are 12
months, unless board members step down early or are removed from office
as the result of an officer review. Board Representatives can serve up
to 3 consecutive terms, after which they must remain off the Board for
at least 12 months before attempting reelection.
  </p>
<p> Currently, CHEA consists of Sasona and La Reunion, however we are happy and confident to expand.</p>
