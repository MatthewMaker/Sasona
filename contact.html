		and just north of the intersection of Lamar and Manchaca. Turn West
		from Lamar onto La Casa drive, and in two blocks you will turn left
		onto Paramount avenue. Keep heading down Paramount avenue until it dead
		ends into our parking lot. The house sprawls around the entrance to the
		parking lot, but you are welcome at any one of the doors facing you! -->
